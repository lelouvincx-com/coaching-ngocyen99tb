# Mentor Handbook

:::warning
This is the mentor's personal handbook. Nice to read, not required.
:::

- **Philosophy**: This is not a SQL course. This is a Role-Playing Game.
- **Goal**: Simulate a lifecycle of a real data project - from the ambiguity of the initial ask to the technical dept of the final deliverable.
- **Method**:
  - We present the student with "The Happy Path" (simple requests), expecting them to fall into the "Pitfalls" (common analytical errors), so we can teach them how to climp out.
  - Along the way, we introduce tools and techniques to help them solve the problems.
