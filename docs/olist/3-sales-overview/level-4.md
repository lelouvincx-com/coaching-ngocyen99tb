# 4. Price vs. Freight Structure

## Problem

:::info Question
Sofia looks at the chart. "Wait, does this revenue figure include what customers paid for shipping? Because we pay that money straight to the shipping vendors; we don't keep it. If shipping is high, our margins are lower."

Can you help distinguish between Product Revenue (Price) and Shipping Revenue (Freight)?

Deliverable:

- A Metabase question that shows the breakdown of revenue into Price vs. Freight.
