## Problem

:::info Question
Sofia is busy. She sends you a Slack message:

> I don't have time to play with the filters right now. Just write me a 3-bullet summary of what this dashboard tells us about our business health. I'll read it on my way to the board meeting.

Goal: Interpret your own visualizations to craft a narrative. You must translate "Charts" into "Business English".

Look at your dashboard (specifically focusing on the year 2016-2018) and answer:

1. Are we growing? If so, is it steady growth or event-driven?
2. What are we actually selling? Is it what you expected for an e-commerce giant?
3. Look closely at the "Price vs. Freight" chart. Which category looks the most "dangerous" in terms of shipping costs?
