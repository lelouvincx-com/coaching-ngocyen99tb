# 5. Dashboard

## Problem 1

:::info Question
You have built 4 powerful individual components. Now Sofia isn't going to open four separate browser tabs every morning. She wants one link.

> This is great analysis, but I want to sip my coffee, glance at one screen, and know if I should panic or celebrate. I can't just open four different tabs every morning, too inconvenient.

Assemble your saved questions into a Dashboard.

## Problem 2

:::info Question
Beginners often drag charts onto a dashboard like they are sticking magnets on a fridge: randomly placed, different sizes, with no logical flow.

It's time to learn the Z-Pattern Layout.

We will arrange the dashboard to follow the way the human eye naturally scans a page (Top-Left → Top-Right → Bottom):

- Top Left (Anchor): The Big Number (KPI).
- Top/Middle (Context): The Trend Line.
- Bottom (Detail): The Breakdowns (Categories & Economics).
