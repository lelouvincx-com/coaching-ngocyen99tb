# 1. Total Revenue

## Problem

:::info Question
Sofia (the last VP of Sales):

> Hi Yen, thank you for your last help.
> Actually we are flying blind right now.
> I need a dashboard that tells me how much money we have processed in history and how many orders that represents.
> Can you do me that favor? Keep it simple, I need it for my slide deck tomorrow.

Your goal is to answer two questions:

1. What is our Total Revenue?
2. How many orders have we processed?

**Deliverable:**

This time, **save it as Metabase's questions**:

- Metabase questions that answer the two questions above.
  - Name: `KPI - Total Revenue` and `KPI - Total Orders`
